    <h1>About</h1>

    <div class="prose">
      <p class="lede">
        Percussion lessons are clear, encouraging, and practical — designed to help students build strong
        fundamentals, grow confidence, and make steady musical progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with beginners who are just getting started, students preparing for school ensembles,
        and advancing players refining technique and musicianship. Lessons are structured around each
        student’s goals, with an emphasis on consistency, listening, and musical understanding.

        <h2>In-person &amp; online lessons</h2>
        <p>
          Lessons are available in person or online. With a simple setup, online lessons can be just as
          effective, and I’ll help you choose an approach that works well for your space and schedule.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card half">
        <h2>Common areas of focus</h2>
        <p>
          Snare drum and mallet instruments, reading and rhythm, technique and sound quality, ensemble skills,
          audition preparation, and performance confidence.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>How scheduling works</h2>
        <p>
          Current clients schedule lessons through a private online booking system. If you’re interested
          in starting lessons, please reach out through the contact page and I’ll share availability and
          next steps.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>What to expect</h2>
        <p>
          Lessons are supportive and focused, with clear expectations and achievable goals. We’ll track
          progress over time and adjust plans as skills and interests develop.
